# Yugal 8 CLI
This script will be built as installable .exe and .deb file so that developers don't need to install Node JS to run Yugal CLI. Currently its in testing mode. However its in late testing, if you have Python install in your computer, then you can download main.py file in your Yugal Project's root and start using it instead of changing permissions manually.
